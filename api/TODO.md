- Individual Get: Check Mongo First? Check both and zip? 
- Save: Add isOwned
- Save: should merge??? 
- Getting individual results from omdb returns much more detail
- Make repo methods async

- Organize a bit more: create additional repos, maybe create helper to write data? 
- Zip search results with results from db 
- Add tests? 
- Go deployed to GCP hello world 
- Rename package to include github


- Polish ideas
    - Create actual structs with names even if they are empty interfaces? This would *feel* more strongly typed? I think it just *feels* more go based on examples I've seen.
